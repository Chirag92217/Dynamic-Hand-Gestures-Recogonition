# Dynamic-Hand-Gestures-Recogonition
Dynamic Hand Gesture Recognition using MediaPipe &amp; LSTM This project implements real-time dynamic hand gesture recognition using MediaPipe for hand keypoint detection and an LSTM-based deep learning model for gesture classification. It supports training on custom datasets and provides live webcam-based gesture recognition.
